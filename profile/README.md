## 🌟 What is Pact?
Pact isn’t just an app – it’s a **student ecosystem**.
By connecting marketplaces, events, and communities, Pact helps students trade, socialize, and grow in a safer, more trustworthy environment.

Pact brings students together in their university communities through two main features:
- **Marketplace** – Buy and sell items safely with escrow-style transactions, QR/PACT codes, and campus-first security.
- **Events** – Discover, create, and join events within your university or broader city communities.

Signing up is simple: log in with your university email, get verified, and instantly join your campus community. From there, you can also opt into general communities (like *London General* or *Milan General*).

## 🔐 Key Features
- **Escrow Transactions**  
  Buyers pay securely into Pact’s escrow. At the meetup, a one-time-use **PACT code** or **QR code** confirms the exchange, releasing funds safely to the seller.
- **Community-Verified Access**  
  Automatic university-based community membership with verified student emails.
- **Event Discovery**  
  Browse map views of events around your campus and in other communities that are open to yours.
- **Temporary Chats**  
  Chat between buyers and sellers, archived automatically after transactions or 3 days of inactivity.
